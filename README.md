Linux Kernel: Booting Process, Working Principal,  Core Subservice for absolutely beginner with no CSE background. 

## Learning Path
1. Read kernel.md (theory)
2. Build k_proc_observer.c (first module)
3. Explore process_telemetry.c
4. Study process_telemetry_v2.c
5. Extend with your own ideas

### Note 
“I built this while learning Linux kernel internals from scratch, documenting concepts in a beginner-first way so others don’t feel lost.”

# Disclaimer 
⚠️ This repository focuses on kernel observability and learning.
It does not include stealth, hiding, or rootkit techniques.
All modules use official kernel APIs.
