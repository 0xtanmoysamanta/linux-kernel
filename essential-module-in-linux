🧩 Useful Linux Kernel Modules (Real-World)

1️⃣ Core System Modules (Almost Every Linux Uses These)

Module	Purpose	Why it matters

ext4	EXT4 filesystem	Storage backbone
xfs	High-performance FS	Servers, databases
loop	Loopback devices	ISOs, containers
fuse	Filesystem in userspace	SSHFS, AppImages
overlay	Overlay FS	Docker, Podman
vfat	FAT support	USB, EFI


💡 If you understand these, you understand Linux storage.


---

2️⃣ Hardware & Device Driver Modules

Module	Purpose

i915, amdgpu, nouveau	GPU drivers
snd_hda_intel	Audio
uvcvideo	Webcam
btusb	Bluetooth
ath9k, iwlwifi	Wi-Fi
nvme, ahci	SSD / SATA


📌 These teach real driver architecture (probe, init, IRQ, DMA).


---

3️⃣ Networking & Security Modules

Module	What it does

nf_tables	Modern firewall (nftables)
ip_tables	Legacy iptables
br_netfilter	Bridge firewall
wireguard	VPN
tun	Virtual networking
macvlan	Container networking


🔥 Kernel networking knowledge = elite skill.


---

4️⃣ Observability & Performance Modules (High Value)

Module	Why important

kprobes	Kernel instrumentation
tracepoints	Event tracing
perf	Performance profiling
ebpf	Safe kernel introspection
audit	Security logging


💰 These are used by Google, Meta, Cloudflare, AWS.


---

5️⃣ Virtualization & Containers

Module	Purpose

kvm	Virtual machines
vhost_net	Fast networking
cgroup_*	Resource control
nsproxy	Namespaces
vfio	PCI passthrough


📦 Containers exist because of these modules.

🛠️ Custom Kernel Modules You Can Build (Portfolio-Safe)

These are ethical, respected, and impressive.


---

🧠 1. Process Telemetry Module

What it does

Counts forks / exits

Tracks longest-running process

Exposes /proc/process_stats


Learn

task_struct

Notifiers

/proc



---

⚙️ 2. CPU Scheduler Observer

What it does

Logs context switches

Measures task runtime

Shows scheduling fairness


Learn

CFS basics

Kernel timing

Performance analysis



---

💾 3. Disk I/O Monitor Module

What it does

Tracks read/write counts

Per-process disk usage

/proc/disk_telemetry


Learn

Block layer

I/O scheduling

Latency analysis



---

🌐 4. Network Flow Counter

What it does

Counts packets per interface

Detects traffic spikes

Simple DoS detection logic


Learn

Netfilter hooks

---

❌ What NOT to Build (Bad for Career)

🚫 Process-hiding modules
🚫 Syscall table patching
🚫 Rootkits
🚫 Credential manipulation
🚫 Stealth persistence

These:

Break modern kernels

Get you flagged

Have zero hiring value



---

🧾 How to Frame This Publicly (Important)

Use language like:

Kernel observability

System introspection

Performance monitoring

Linux internals research

Security telemetry


Never say:

“hidden”

“stealth”

“undetectable”



---

🚀 Recommended Build Order (Smart Path)

1. Process Telemetry


2. /proc + seq_file mastery


3. Disk I/O monitor


4. Network counter


5. eBPF version of one module


6. LSM / audit concepts



This path takes you from student → serious kernel engineer.
